# Database of Surfaces in 6-cube

The purpose of this database is to demonstrate the realizability of specific f-vectors for surfaces in the 6-cube. For each topological type of surface that we were able to realize and for each f-vector, it contains exactly one surface that realizes that f-vector.

Since the f-vector is completely determined by the surface type and the number of vertices, we list only the (demi)genus and the number of vertices. For example, "g7-v44" means (orientable) "genus 7, 44 vertices", while "dg27-v63" means (non-orientable) "demigenus 27, 63 vertices".

The subfolder "orientable" contains the orientable surfaces, while "even" and "odd" contain non-orientable surfaces of even and odd demigenus (respectively).
